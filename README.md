### mb_helper3_1.0.zip
A really simple custom AXI4-Lite peripheral which was created using Vivado 2020.1 wizard using VHDL. I did not even include an S00 axi interface, I simply enabled interrupts and it autogenerated 5 memory-mapped registers which work with Xilinx's intc driver. The driver for this IP is located in microblaze-drivers/custom_interrupt_example.c.
